# This is Data Visualization Dashboard Application.

Data visualization Dashboard Application preview here: [Data Visualization Dashboard](https://data-visualization-dashb-b7373.web.app/).

- In this application, I show some data like (Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance, Year, Country, Topics, Region, and City) by the chart to better understand or visualize
- I filter data in the dashboard in various ways which means you can see data visualize like (end year filter, topics filter, sector filter, region filter, PEST filter, Source filter, SWOT filter, Country, and City).
- I also implement firebase for authentication purposes, where users can sign up or log in. Without login or signing up user cannot see the dashboard page.
- For showing char with data I use **Chart.js** and react-chart.js-2. By Chart.js I created charts easily.
- Technology: **Chart.js**, React-chart.js-2, React, React-router, Firebase, React-firebase-hook, React-hook-form, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, etc.
